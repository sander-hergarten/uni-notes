# Headspace ideas
- minutes meditated
- people who download headspace are already interested in meditation
- 2 people use headspace:
	1. People who enjoy meditating and were looking for a companion app

- This causes a problem where Headspace, instead of trying to maximize user happiness tries to maximize users meditation rate.
